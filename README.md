Traffic Management System Overview
This solution integrates:
1️⃣ Dynamic Traffic Light Adjustment: Leveraging YOLO-based car detection, the system dynamically calculates green light durations for each lane based on vehicle count.
2️⃣ User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, the GUI allows users to either analyze traffic through video feeds or manually input car counts for simulation.
3️⃣ Optimized Traffic Flow: By adapting to real-time conditions, this system ensures smoother traffic management and reduced delays.

Key Features
✅ Automated Vehicle Detection: Real-time analysis using a pre-trained YOLO model.
✅ Manual & Automated Modes: Users can choose between video feed analysis or manual data entry.
✅ Dynamic Timing Calculations: Allocates green light durations based on traffic density, ensuring balanced flow across all lanes.
✅ Interactive GUI: Simple yet powerful, making it accessible for various users.
